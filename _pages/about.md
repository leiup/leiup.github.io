I am currently a researcher and development engineer working in Baidu Intelligent Driving Group (IDG), and simultaneously a postdoctor fellow at the University of Tsinghua, supervised by Prof. Jie Zhou. In June 2018, I received my PhD degree from the National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA), supervised by Prof. Zhanyi Hu and Prof. Guanghui Wang. Prior to this, I received my BS degree from BeiHang University in June 2013.

My research focuses on computer vision, machine learning and pattern recognition. I am interested in L4 Hdmap Autonomous Update: how to use the state-of-the-art algorithms to update the L4 Hdmap more efficiently and effectively.
